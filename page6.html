  <h2><i>What I remember most:</i></h2>
  <p>
    October 29, 2025 – Azure FrontDoor global outage. The service was completely down and our web app became inaccessible.  
    I applied a temporary workaround by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/networking/global-web-applications/mission-critical-content-delivery#approach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding Azure Traffic Manager in front of FrontDoor</a> (normally, Microsoft recommends using either FrontDoor or Traffic Manager, not both).  
    Our service availability was restored within 30 minutes, minimizing user impact.  
    I remember this most because it was an "all the dots connected" moment - my prior study of the architecture pattern paid off under real-world pressure.
